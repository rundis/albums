== Preconditions

=== Backend
The backend is written in Haskell and uses https://haskell-servant.github.io/[servant] to serve
a REST-api.

.You will need to install:
. Haskell (and Cabal). You might want to install https://www.haskell.org/platform/[Haskell platform]

=== Frontend
The frontend is written in http://elm-lang.org/[Elm]

.You will need to install:
. http://elm-lang.org/install[Elm platform]



== Get it up and running

Firstly just clone this repo. If you wish to try out the demo app corresponding with
a particular episode of the accompanying blog series, checkout the appropriate tag (named after each episode)


=== Backend
. Open a terminal and cd to `$albums/backend`
. `cabal sandbox init && cabal update && cabal init`
. `cabal install --only-dependencies && cabal configure`
. `cabal build`
. `cabal run`

You may test that it's up and running by `curl http://localhost:8081/artists/1`



=== Frontend
. Open a terminal and cd to `$albums/frontend`
. `elm-package install --yes`
. `elm-make Album.elm --output album.js`
. `elm-reactor`

Open a browser window with the following url: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`

WARNING: You will run into a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[CORS] issue
since the frontend is hosted by elm-reactor on a separate port from the rest services hosted by the servant server.
There are a couple of options for handling this (until Servant gets proper cors support). The simplest option
is to install https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi[this] Chrome plugin.
Another option would be for you to set up something like nginx in front of both servers.
